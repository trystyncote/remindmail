Disclaimer: This is a project for a college-level software development class, and is therefore not an actual software. This is primarily to demonstrate understanding, and for practice.

# RemindMail

RemindMail (placeholder name; “the software”) is defined as an email-based reminder system, in terms of a web service. The premise is to act as a component of {SOME PROJECT*}, so the interface may not necessarily be user-friendly, since it’s meant for internal use.

The software is split into further components, with the primary two being the setup of the web service interface, and the ability to send emails. Further features have to do with the internal functionality, or alternative access.
